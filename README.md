### Extra Resources

[Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://medium.com/dunder-data/minimally-sufficient-pandas-a8e67f2a2428)
· A really great post by Ted Petrou with an opinionated guide to which commands and styles of
coding should be used with Pandas. There are so many ways of doing the same thing in Pandas
and he helps clarify which to choose and why. *Not a beginner article, but essential for intermediate
to advanced users.*

[Github Markdown cheat sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
· Super-concise summary of (github-style) Markdown syntax

[Pandas cheat sheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
· Modeled after R cheat sheet. Very good summary of basic Pandas functions
